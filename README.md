Open the .ijm file in FIJI as a macro (Plugins...Macros...Edit...)
Add the path for the folder containing all input folders (main_folder) and results folder (results_folder). 
Here, main_folder is an overview folder, containing image-folders for various experiments or settings.
And results_folder is the folder that will contain all result folders from each input folder in the main_folder.
Change background values to find optimal settings (bg_values and bg_values_offset)
